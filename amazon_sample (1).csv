After reading the first chapter I was intrigued and could not put the book down. Levitt's studies should be brought to the college, maybe high school level, as the topics generate substantial conversation pieces that can be used for more explanation and research.    Although I could tend to agree that I would have enjoyed learning more substance for each topic (chapter) of the book, it was early explained that there was no unifying or underlying theme to the book.  I have gained a lot from the book and hope to see more like it in the future. Great read!"

So I am holding back on this one. This collection is a collection of more recent essays. To a large extent he deals with much of the same issues as in Stream of Windows - are Free Trade Agreements ( what he calls Preferential Trade Agreements) really free trade? Is the  blue  and  green  protectionism based on solid arguments or incomplete analysis? etc The one new section is on Capital Controls. There is a series of articles , especially his famous/notorious Foreign Affairs article, where he argues that while trade in goods and services has gains that have been demonstrated, those in short-term capital haven't been so unambiguously demonstrated. Therefore he advises restraint about capital account convertibility to those who haven't done so already. His caution is based not just on the irrationalities of the 97 East Asia crisis , but also on careful analyses by several economists which show that speculators who bet against a country's fundamentals are not (necessarily) punished. They can actually change the fundamentals. Therefore short-term capital flow can have noxious effects not associated with trade in goods and services. Anyway, good collection, yes repetitive (as another reader says) like the Stream of Windows , but ultimately good reading about careful thoughts on globalization , as opposed to all this pop-literature floating around. Some intellectual discipline for a layman like me."
R1NZUXASKQOOXC,cafic,Fiction,49474042,1931561249,Dream of the Blue Room,5,exquisite storytelling...,2005-07-21,"Reviewed by Joanna Pearson for Small Spiral Notebook    Foreign travel is about learning to exist in a dreamy state of in-between-ness. Unknown and ungrounded, you wander through strange environs seeing strange faces, and yet the ever-resourceful mind manages to seize upon vague familiarities, constructing a hybrid place that has the eerie quality of a dreamscape. So we find our main character, Jenny, on a cruise ship in China in Michelle Richmond's debut novel Dream of a Blue Room. Tense and insomniac, Jenny has traveled here on a dual mission: to resolve her collapsing marriage one way or the other, and to scatter the ashes of her murdered childhood best friend. As in all good stories that unfold on a plane, train, bus, or ship (with a nod to the Hitchcockian principle), Jenny soon finds her task complicated by the pull she feels towards Graham, a fellow traveler she meets who has his own reasons for making this voyage.     Redmond excels in conjuring that state of heightened, dream-like awareness fueled by lack of sleep and periods of intense emotional stress. Her deft descriptions of the Chinese landscape and Yangtze serve as a context for Jenny's extended meditation on her own riverside childhood in Alabama and the history of her failing marriage. The two settings and time periods are ambitiously and successfully interwoven, much to Redmond's credit. She is as en point in her descriptions of Chinese river dolphins, funeral ceremonies, and elderly tea shop ladies as she is in her descriptions of tubing, Sunday School, and watermelons in Mobile. Much more than travel fiction, this is instead a story of growing up as an outsider in the South, revealed through contrast-like looking at the negatives of a series of photos in order to see what you couldn't have noticed otherwise. In this way, China triggers a reflection on Jenny's life back home, proof of the idea that one understands home the best when away from it. We realize very quickly that Jenny's relationship with the murdered Amanda Ruth was more than a mere friendship. Redmond beautifully describes the intimacy, both physical and emotional, between two girls during the pivotal period of late adolescence, as well as the grinding forces of Southern culture and religion that threatened this intimacy.     For the most part, Redmond's prose has a lovely lyricality. She is at her best when describing situations with clarity and simplicity-she has a keen sense of place, an eye for details like how the raindrops fall at a particular instant. Redmond is a sensual writer and on occasion, her writing can veer towards the overripe, particularly when describing erotic moments. There could have been fewer oversignified descriptions of sex, and the book would have been none the worse for it. Throughout most of the novel, however, Redmond's touch is far subtler, allowing a memory of a summer afternoon in a boathouse or a Chinese funeral procession to do no more symbolic load bearing than warranted.     As the cruise ship eases down the river, the reality of Jenny's ending marriage becomes apparent even as her relationship with newcomer Graham rapidly progresses. It is through this new, albeit short-lived relationship with Graham and the drastic act he requests of her that Jenny is ultimately able to exit her suspended state. With the slow build-up of a mystery, the exquisite pain of a coming-of-age novel, the masterful images of a travel writer, and a darkness that is true to the Southern Gothic, Dream of a Blue Room is a work of wonderfully chimeric form. And through this, a novelistic form that skillfully defies a single genre, Redmond, quite fittingly, tells the story of a woman finding her way out of the boundaries of singular categories, out of limbo, out of the in-between."
R1KVDW3U9FPBZ2,cafic,Fiction,52986379,0679741925,The Reivers,5,A Joy To Read,2000-08-23,"At long last, Faulkner gave us lucky readers a great comic novel.  Those  long difficult sentences are timed to deliver punch lines, and the  atmosphere is light and sunny rather than gloomy and dank.  This is not to  say that the novel is merely a diversion, though.  The final resolution is  deeply moving, and still most entertaining.   This is one of the books  that makes me glad I learned how to read."

I learned to appreciate a different perspective - a perspective where information technologies are placed in a balanced contextual relationship to social values, and to human needs and relationships.  Other books I have read survey technology from the standpoint of technological determinism, or as the book says, from the standpoint of the ""blinkered euphoria of the infoenthusiast.""  This book is a good reading and it seeds deeper discussion and thought. Since I work in the field of distance learning, I found Chapter 5, ""Learning - in Theory and in Practice,"" Chapter 6, ""Innovating Organization, Husbanding Knowledge,"" Chapter 7 - ""Reading the Background,"" and Chapter 8, ""Re-education,"" particularly interesting and relevant.  The authors identify three differences between information and knowledge:  1) knowledge usually entails a knower (the person who knows), 2) knowledge appears harder to detach (than information), and 3) knowledge requires assimilation.  So these days, with all the talk about hot distance education trends and increasing on-line and other technology-mediated educational programming, we need to remain mindful of the need for technology-mediated programming to empower folks to learn, i.e., acquire and assimilate knowledge. I also appreciated Brown and Duguid's insightful discussion regarding changes in higher education.  It is true that an opportunity exists to provide greater access to higher education through the expanding use of information technologies.  But, it is important to distinguish the current hype about distance learning from the reality of what really is currently available and accessible.  The authors also draw distinctions between social distance and geographical distance and the dangers of polarization.  I also agree that the goal should be access to higher education."

Pity they all came from people who voted for a crook because he said he liked guns and not abortion.  Well, guys, when you're sitting in your tiny grey cubes on Monday, with your bosses forcing you to work 86 hours a week and your health insurance company making you do it until you are 75 years old (if you live that long), only for you to discover at 75 that you have to bag groceries at the Quickie Mart for your benefits until the day you die, all the more so as the same bosses that made you work 86 hours a week spent all your pension to send their corporate offspring to business or law school, while your kids (if you can afford the insurance to have any) are all drafted into the marines to kill Arabs or naughty Europeans or some other object of hate for this week, which is just as well because you don't need a good education to get into the marines and they won't have one, and you can't travel anywhere beyond the Canadian border because your country is loathed worldwide, and your SUV is sitting in the front yard unused for five years because you and other morons like you hogged all the oil and we have run out of countries to pillage and natural areas to dig up, so you are stuck at home, then you may, just MAY, take the time to read this book and THINK for a while about what a MESS you and people like you are making of this country."

I'd begin the season playing well then the more I played the more inconsistent my play became. Last week, while playing with a friend I had one of the worst rounds I could remember.  My friend mentioned that my swing looked out of synch.  With that feedback I searched the internet for a book or a tool to help me with my timing and tempo.  I discovered the Tour Tempo on Amazon.com and purchased the book. At the onset, my initial impression was that the book and disc had the feel of an infomercial to buy more training products, so I was very skeptical.  I pressed on, reading the book in one sitting and watched the videos.  The information in this book hit home with me because I knew that tempo was important, and this book gave me a tool to practice good tempo. My mechanics are sound, (handicap 14), but the inconsistencies seem to always sabotage my round.  After one, one hour session on the range listening to the disc, followed by pre-round listening to the disc I enjoyed one of my best rounds ever - 80.  I started my round with birdie, par, birdie, par, hitting the first four greens in regulation. Better yet I was hitting the ball extremely well, shot after shot.    The secret was to focus on every shot, making a practice swing before every shot until I could feel that I was in synch before I even addressed the ball.  The ""Swing, Set, Through"" rythm really works if applied with diligence.  The book and the enclosed disc are all you need to get started."

R1NXIDRJHVJM1Q,nafic,Fiction,27609705,0515138657,Black Rose (In The Garden Trilogy),3,Same Old Same Old,2005-08-18,"Okay...I am going to risk incurring the wrath of Nora Robert's minions by being negative about this book.      First off, was it better than the first book?  Yes, definitely.  The character is much more developed, the romance is more developed, the harper bride (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole series and my sole reason for reading them) is more developed, and the plot is more developed.    However, it is the same old tired love story!  Is this the only kind of love Nora Roberts can describe???  Is this the only type of romance in the world?  And to you dedicated Nora Robert's fans....Don't you want to read a story where the ending is uncertain, where love may mean sacrificing a relationship, etc?  There are so many other kinds of love and romance stories out there.  And Roberts continues to use the same one...over and over and over ad nauseum.      Roberts has the potential to be an awesome writer.  She just settles for being less.  It's true she's a bestseller, but are her books meaningful or important?  No.  They are just books that romance-starved women read to feel a sense of completeness in their lives.    The surrounding story of the Harper bride is wonderful!  The romance, on the other hand, is tired and trite.  I wish Roberts had discluded romance entirely or made it secondary to the plot.  It's just boring.  Just like we all know that in the end of Red Lily, Harper and Hayley will profess their love and hook up permanently.  No surprise.  None.  I'm only going to read it for the Harper Bride part.    So, overall, if you love Roberts, you'll love this.  I don't love her, so I don't love this.  Grade C- (2.5 stars)"

The novel is tender and forgiving.  Bits of it left me stuck in an emotion.  It is by no means a ""perfect novel"" whatever that would be...there are names that I would change, particular lines that stick out like an unfinished hem.  But what you feel like while reading is that you're swirling around in the lives of these broken characters, and when you put the book down, they linger.  Their problems are recognizable, human.  That aside, she's hilarious.  Just buy the thing and read for yourself."
R163QY58P7LWOG,cafic,Fiction,49336695,006019491X,Daughter of Fortune: A Novel,5,True to form and truly beautiful,2000-06-18,"Whenever I have ever heard anybody say of a book that they could not put it down, I usually shrugged it off, thinking the speaker to be a bit too dramaic.  That is however, until I came across  -- purely by chance --  Isabel Allende.  Daughter of Fortune continues the marvelous work of a  very gifted author.  A captivating story, with marvelous characters; a  thing of beauty.  If you have ever wanted to lose yourself in a story, then  this is a book you should read.  And when you finish, and your soul longs  for more (as, I guarantee you, you will; Ms. Allende has a knack for  getting you so into her characters and her stories that they become so much  a part of you, and you actually miss them when the story is over), why not  read the others in her collection, if you have not already?  You will have  the same feeling about each one. Yes, critics will say the story has, in  a broad sense, a theme similar to all her works, but Ms. Allende here shows  her true art, for in retelling that theme, she never seems to make you  quite feel as if you've heard it all before.  Her descriptions, both of  character and scenery, always draw you in, bringing you deeper into the  magical world she has created.  Daughter of Fortune accomplishes that.  I  don't want to give anything away about it; just get the book, open it up  and you will soon see what I mean. I anxiously await her next work, which  based on the ending of this one, I suspect will be a continuation of the  saga of Eliza and Tao Chi'en."
R12BC1SF97ADU1,nafic,Fiction,26037399,0553375407,Ishmael:A Novel,4,Good for seeing the big picture,2005-08-24,"This is a good book for helping one see the big picture. You may have asked yourself: what is going on? It's hard to answer when you're stuck in the belly of the beast.    I'll spoil it. If all goes well, we will grow so much that we fill the universe. That is the underlying goal of our civilization, to grow.    With some distance it doesn't seem like such a noble or special thing, and the book is excellent at giving you the perspective of the observer.    That is the strength of the book. However, the book also makes the argument that a life of coexistence is preferable, for example, one of a tribal hunter/gatherer society.    This you may not swallow. You may not be convinced that humans are going to perish before they become powerful enough to escape the consequences of environmental damage. You may think that a long and uneventful, if happy, life as a species sounds no better than one of endless growth (or at least the attempt).     Still, one can't expect to find the meaning of life. The book is strong enough as a criticism of our culture to be worth reading."

Unlike other biographers, Hayman has managed to be honest and critical about who Plath is, and how she was treated by people around her, including her husband and his mistress. Hayman addresses critically and honestly Plath's husband controlling nature. He controlled her life when she was alive, but worse still he controlled her totally after she died. There are many crucial works and correspondences of Plath that were destroyed, or mysteriously disappeared (presumable by her husband). Hayman argues that these materials are extremely valuable to understand more Plath's life as suicide."

At the core of the book is Ms. Muir's message that we are part of nature, not separate from or above nature, and we have a great responsibility to maintain the integrity  of the environment. Granted, this message is not new. Where this book is  very different is how Ms. Muir leads up to this message. She shows how the  New England landscape changed from one where farming dominated to one that  was a mixture of many different types of mills and factories. You learn the  consequences of everything that was done along the way: the consequences to  fish and birds of damming rivers; the consequences to forests and to the  air we breath of heavy logging; the consequences of catching too many of  one type of fish, etc. What is great about this book is that Ms. Muir does  not deal in hazy generalities. She takes you step by step and shows you  specifically how certain actions cause certain changes in the environment,  often unforseen. There is nothing simplistic in her observations and she  knows there are no easy answers. She lays out the data for you and you can  come to your own conclusions. But what really takes this book to another  level is the fascinating biographical information that Ms. Muir provides  concerning the many, many New Englanders that invented the machines of the  Industrial Revolution and kept the economy vibrant as the importance of  agriculture diminished. The way this book is put together is very unusual,  due to the combination of all of the above factors and in the space of 248  pages you will learn a great deal of information. The research Ms. Muir  must have done in writing this book is staggering and her knowledge across  many different areas is amazing. Don't miss reading this book."

Each page is becomes more blatent. It's impossible for any book to be completely void of bias, but Randall Price doesn't even make an effort to lay out the facts and let the reader draw their own conclusion. It's just riduculous. I usually buy my books instead of borrowing from the library in order to support the authors; but take my advice and save you money with this one.  That is, of course, unless your mind is already made up and you simply want to feel better about your obstinance."

Events that would seem major to others do not effect him in any emotional way.  When his mother dies, he is not saddened in the least bit, and goes on a date the day after her funeral.  When he becomes involved in the dangerous affairs of an amoral pimp named Raymond, Meursault's fate takes a turn for the worst.  He eventually commits a pointless murder, and faces the possibility of having to face the worst consequence possible; execution.    The simple narrative of this novel parallels the theme of existentialism, and the pointlessness of life.  This book definetely requires reading between the lines, so it is not for everyone.  Some also believe that the author's outlook on life highly influences the novel, while I believe that it does not hinder the potency of the message."

He connects the dots like the Cubans in Miami connect the dots between Castro and everything wrong with the world! This is nothing more than another boring, unending tome trying to justify the fantasy that Saddam and bin Laden were in cahoots. Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of Islam and modern middle-Eastern history knows that the two were (or, rather, are) natural enemies and would NEVER co-operate, however one fantasizes about connecting the dots. The fact is that Bush wanted to invade Iraq from day one, and he found - rather, tried to find - a thousand excuses to do so. What is most amazing is that the world allowed itself to be bamboozled by the only remaining evil empire into approving the invasion of Iraq. That the American public did so is no surprise!"

Bush,4,A dire warning.,2004-08-02,"I recommend this book for the fact that it addresses the issue of the over-expansion of power of the executive branch. The Constitution of the United States defines the Presidency in a limited role in the federal government. Through the years both Democrat and Republican presidents have expanded the powers of the Oval Office beyond its intended purpose. This book is obviously a negative critique of the policies of George W. Bush, but it also serves as a dire warning. John Dean speaks from experience about the dangers of what he calls an  imperial presidency . This is much more than a attack on Bush. It is a demand for the transparency, and checks-and balances our government requires."
R3EPPQEON8N9RI,canf,Nonfiction,53075255,0871139065,The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia,5,part II of review,2003-12-04,"China handles ethnic minorities with less bloodshed.  Eastern Turkestan was conquered in the eighteenth century and renamed Xinjiang.  Since it had value only as a buffer, China allowed the population to continue to speak Uighur, worship as Muslims, and support themselves in simple, pastoral poverty.   Two things changed.  It was discovered that northern Xinjiang holds massive oil and gas reserves.  And the mandarins in Beijing noticed that a pipeline across Xinjiang could bring Caspian oil to Shanghai. China has moved rapidly to secure its sole Muslim province with the same methods that it is using in Tibet, methods honed in the earlier takeovers of Hunan, Sichuan, and most of the rest of what we think of as China proper.  Unlike western imperialists, who have often left ethnic identities intact, the Chinese method is to move huge numbers of Han Chinese into the conquered territory.  Resettle natives in ways that disrupt community.  Reserve the best land and jobs for Han Chinese, while at the same time markedly improving the standards of living, educational, and economic opportunities of the natives.  Then wait.  Almost no one dies in the Chinese method of ethnic cleansing, but it does effectively terminate entire cultures.  In a few generations, the culture and identity of the Muslim Uighurs will fade into history, like the cultures of over 50 other ethnic minority groups that linger at the margins of Chinese provinces where their ancestors flourished.  Meanwhile, Uighur and perhaps Caspian oil will flow to the Chinese heartland. Kleveman's book is a splendid introduction not only to the nations of the region, but to the politics of Caspian oil, but it is not always a reliable guide.  Kleveman's profound, almost visceral distrust of American power regularly leads him to misstate fact.   Kleveman writes, for example, of an ""Iran Air passenger plane shot down for no apparent reason by the American battleship U.S.S. Vincennes in 1987.""   Actually, while the incident was indeed a tragedy, there was a reason.   The Vincennes was in the Persian Gulf because of reports that Iran was positioning Chinese-made Silkworm missles near the Strait of Hormuz in a bid to control to control oil supplies.   On the morning of July 3, one of Vincennes's helicopters was fired on by three Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes returned fire.  Five minutes later, the Vincennes detected an aircraft taking off from the civilian-military Bandar Abbas airport. The ship radioed seven warnings to the plane, which apparently went unanswered.  The ship's log shows that the Vincennes identified the plane as an F-14 approaching at an altitude of about 7,000 feet and descending.    The New Great Game is both a great read and an eye-opening introduction to the realpolitik of oil.  It is weakened only by Kelveman's failure to perceive that Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, and several other nations are at least as willing as is the United States to lie, cheat, steal, and kill in the competition for oil."
R1V8REXU70ZRUQ,nanf,Nonfiction,17777931,0385503865,"The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies and Nations",5,Intriguing and useful,2004-06-13,"I decided to read this book after reading an essay that Surowiecki wrote in Wired, arguing that companies and organizations in general put too much trust in the people at the very top and don't rely enough on the collective intelligence of their employees. This is exactly how things are run at the agency where I work. Information doesn't flow the way it should, decisions are made by fiat, and people are more interested in protecting their little fiefdoms than in solving problems intelligently. I was intrigued by the article's argument, but I wanted more detail. After reading the whole book, I'm convinced that the way we do things makes our decisions worse, not better. THE WISDOM OF CROWDS mounts a great case for the virtues of letting more people have a say in decisions, and it does so in a remarkably entertaining way. I thought there was a nice balance between anecdote and analysis here, with the stories -- including a great one about finding a lost submarine, and a detailed analysis of the Columbia disaster -- really illuminating Surowiecki's arguments. Because Surowiecki is challenging the idea that only a few select people should have influence over important decisions, it may be hard for his ideas to have an impact in the corporate and government world. But I'm convinced that this should change for good the way organizations make decisions."

A former Soviet dissident who became the victim of totalitarian brutality under Communism and who shared his experience to advise President Reagan in the Cold War, Sharansky never gave up hope that tyranny would be overcome and the Soviet Union dismantled. With the current terror threat, Sharansky advocates the same hope and optimism. Sharansky agrees with the President's Bush optimistic approach. He doesn't question whether we can bring democracy to the Middle East, but argues that it's critical for security around the world, and with strength, determination, and fierce optimism, we will combat tyranny and terror and make great strides towards world peace."

It is particularly useful for looking up the biographies of artists that you're interested in. Less useful are the lists of jazz club venues - likely to be quite out of date by now. What I liked especially about the dictionary, is its comprehensiveness. Artists from all continents are covered - although musicians from far-flung places (as in not-in-the-USA)are more likely to be missing. On the negative side, you'll find that the book is now out of date when it comes to contemporary musicians. I have for example compiled a list of all artists born in African, Australia and New Zealand from the book. While a number of well-known musicians are missing, the youngest person on my list was born in 1947 - 55 years ago - not good for a book that was reviewed in 1994.  One would suspect that the contemporary jazz renaissance of the 1990s is totally absent. So in summary, this is a well-written, well edited, good reference source, but badly in need of an update. I would also enjoy more personal details about artists in the next edition."
RC5BTNN34K7J7,nanf,Nonfiction,53052943,055380202X,The Universe in a Nutshell,5,A wonderful mind opening book - especially for young people,2004-01-11,"I remember receiving beautiful science books as a boy.  They were wonderfully illustrated with drawings, pictures, and questions about space, the future, the past, and the unknown.  They fascinated me and allowed me to begin thinking about important areas of human understanding without having much of it myself. Dr. Stephen Hawking had a huge unexpected hit with his ""Brief History of Time"", which I, and millions of others, loved.  He came out with an illustrated version, which many of us also purchased.  This book covers different subjects in the same topic of cosmology. I think it is a wonderful book that can capture the imagination of inquisitive young people.  It is written engagingly without being condescending.  It takes its reader seriously while finding ways to explain topics in a non-technical way that otherwise could be mind numbingly opaque.  He even brings in time travel and even Star Trek as a means of discussing certain limitations of our understanding of the universe. Just as the books I read as a young man became outdated by brilliant minds like Dr. Hawking's this one will as well.  However, it can serve a great mind opening purpose for young people and interested adults.  It is not very long, but can spark a lot of thinking and discussion between friends interested in physics and cosmology.  If you are looking for a gift for a bright teenager who likes these topics, this would be a good choice."

Richard Chamberlain has always been a favorite actor of mine.  Watching him on TV in all those swashbuckling films as well as dramas such as  The Thorn Birds,  he served as an artistic inspiration to me when I was younger.  This book did so much more than tell me about the life of one of my favorite actors, but really made me think about how to deal with life and how to find beauty in people and in all things.  What Richard Chamberlain has learned over the years can serve as a great lesson and really open one's eyes.  His is a touching story, is interesting from cover to cover, and extremely well written.  I highly recommend it to any reader."
